Learned about methods also knows as funcrion in simple words 
  Void-- if it does not have any return type then we will use void or else we will use non void like when return is used and u need to print a integer we use public static int add()
  something like that 

  parameter-- when qwe initialize a value inside a method it is parameterized mehtod or function 

  note: we will always use method as a name no functions forget functions
